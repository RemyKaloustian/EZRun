## DOCUMENTATION for Front-end:

Since the app is small, all the work is done in EZRunApp/src/pages/hello-ionic/

In hello-ionic/, we have :
- hello-ionic.html contains the html markup for the app  
- hello-ionic.scss contains the style for the app  
- hello-ionic.ts contains the TypeScript code to manage data.

#### If we were to continue this project

If we were to add more features we would create other views in order to share the responsibilities and not put everything in hello-ionic/
