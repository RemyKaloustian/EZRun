### Running the API

The API based on Lumen Framework (Laravel little brother).

You can launch the API with the script _(you need **PHP** and **Composer** to run the API)_:
 
 ```bash
  $ > ./scripts/run.sh
  ```
  
 The api will be listening on `http://localhost:8080/` by default, unless you pass one argument corresponding to the port number to the run script.
